    * your methods to answering the research question
    * an indication about how strong the evidence is
* Helpful tips
    * Don't reproduce the paper
    * Keep the words to a minimum
    * Choose your words carefully (informative phrases)
    * Have a logical flow
    * Make the font size and font style and text placement legible
    * Visualize your results
* What do you want the reader of and listener to your poster to come away with?

## Optional poster attributes

## How to present your poster (on Wed., June 5)
* Stand by your research (and by your poster)
* In a poster presentation, you are having an exchange with your listener/visitor.
* Start slow, then gauge where your listener/visitor's interests are.
* What do you want them to come away with? What did they actually come away with?
* Don't read from your poster.
* Behave professionally (and dress professionally)
